### Two phase
* Training
* Usage

+++
### Training
1. Configure a learning algo
2. Run training => trained model

### Usage
* We use the model to make predictions

---

### Sample run

Neural net training

---

### Concepts

* Neuron
* Can represent an AND/OR function
* How to represent XOR

+++

Combine Neurons

* 2 layer XOR representation

---

### Multi-layered Perceptron

* Def'n: Type of ANN
* Picture of MLP

+++

### Program representation

* OOP? Matrix?

---

### Training

mlp.train(x, y);

+++

### Usage

y' = mlp.predict(x')
